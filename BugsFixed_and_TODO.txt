Bugs Fixed:
ServerInstance.java
-setPlayer:  Client is set to player 'A'. Correct score is shown.
-letterbank updates:  both letterbanks are sent and letters validated out of current bank.
-updateStatus blank string:  handles if user sends blank string
-updateStatus no word:  handles if user sends no word
-updateStatus quit:  fixed the if branch that deals with player quiting
-updateStatus accepting any word:  checks if word is valid, uses valid letters, and has not been used.
-sendMessage:  checked if string is not null before sending
GUI:
-clear input box:  if a valid word is submitted, it is not cleared from the input box.
-input box height:  too short, cuts off g, y, j, etc.


To Fix:
GUI:
-window size:  auto window width too small on Nels' machine.
