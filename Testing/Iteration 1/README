FOR GameServer:
two clients need to connect to the server before you can test. If you send anything to the server before it says "New Game Started:" it screws up and you need to close both clients and the server.

the C server listens on port 5000
the GameServer listens on port 8128

This is a modified version of a c server and java client based off of code found at: 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19561941/socket-comunication-java-client-c-server

The client takes a string from stdin and sends it to the server and receives a confirmation.
The server needs to run on linux.
The server receives a string from the client and prints it to stdout and sends a confirmation.
Key word "hello" receives a special confirmation.
Key word "bye" closes connection to server but leaves client running.
Exit client with "exit" or <cntl+C>

to compile:
gcc -Wall -Werror spikeServer.c -o spikeServer
javac GameServer
javac spikeClient

to run with local host in seperate cmd windows (two clients are required for GameServer):
./spikeServer
java GameServer
java spikeClient 127.0.0.1 [port]
